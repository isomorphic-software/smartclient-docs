## Class: AutoTest

### Description
Standalone class providing a general interface for integration with Automated Testing Tools

For automated testing tools we need a way to create string identifiers for DOM elements such that when a page is reloaded, we can retrieve a functionally equivalent DOM element. We call these [autoTestLocators](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator).

This allows automated testing tools to set up or record user generated events on DOM elements then play them back on page reload and have our components react correctly.

The primary APIs for the AutoTest subsystem are [AutoTest.getLocator](#classmethod-autotestgetlocator) and [AutoTest.getElement](#classmethod-autotestgetelement). Developers should also be aware of the [AutoTest.installLocatorShortcut](#classmethod-autotestinstalllocatorshortcut) method which allows you to retrive locators via a simple key combo + mouseDown event on the target element.

Implementation considerations:

*   Some components react to the structure of DOM elements embedded within them - for example GridRenderer cells have meaning to the grid. So in some cases we need to identify elements within a component, while in others we can just return a pointer to a handle (A simple canvas click handler doesn't care about what native DOM element within the handle received the click).
*   When a DOM element is contained by a component, it is not sufficient to store the component ID. Most SmartClient components are auto-generated by their parents, and rather than attempting to store a specific component identifier we should instead store the "logical function" of the component.  
    For example a listGrid header button may have a different auto-generated ID across page reloads due to various timing-related issues (which can change the order of of widget creation), loading a new skin, or otherwise trivial changes to an application.  
    Rather than storing the header button ID therefore, we want to store this as a string meaning "The header button representing field X within this list grid".
*   fallback strategies: In some cases a component or DOM element can be identified in several ways. For example a cell in a ListGrid can be identified by simple row and column index, but also by fieldName and record primary key value. In these cases we attempt to record information for multiple locator strategies and then when parsing stored values we can provide APIs to govern which strategy is preferred. See the [LocatorStrategy](../reference_2.md#type-locatorstrategy) documentation for more on this.

In order to address these concerns the AutoTest locator pattern is similar to an XPath type structure, containing a root component identifier, followed by details of sub-components and then potentially details used to identify an element within the components handle in the DOM.  
The actual implementation covers a large number of common cases, including (but not limited to) the following. Note that for cases where an element is being identified from a pool of possible candidates, such as the [Canvas.children](Canvas.md#attr-canvaschildren) array, we usually will use [fallback locator paths](../reference_2.md#type-locatorstrategy) rather than simply relying on index:

*   Root level components identified by explicit ID
*   Any [autoChildren](../reference.md#type-autochild)
*   Standard component parts such as scrollbars, edges, shadows, etc
*   Section stack items and headers
*   Window items
*   ListGrid headers and cells
*   TreeGrid headers and cells, including interactive open icon, checkbox icons
*   DynamicForm form items, including details of elements within those items

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.isSystemDone

### Description
Returns a boolean to indicate whether the current application is fully loaded with no pending operations, and is ready for user interaction. This includes the following checks:

*   page has finished loading
*   all ListGrids (as defined by isc.isA.ListGrid) satisfy [AutoTest.isGridDone](#classmethod-autotestisgriddone)
*   all TileGrids that are drawn satisfy [AutoTest.isTileGridDone](#classmethod-autotestistilegriddone)
*   all TileLayouts that are drawn satisfy [AutoTest.isTileLayoutDone](#classmethod-autotestistilelayoutdone)
*   all DynamicForms that are drawn satisfy [AutoTest.isFormDone](#classmethod-autotestisformdone)
*   all Canvii that are drawn satisfy [AutoTest.isCanvasDone](#classmethod-autotestiscanvasdone)

In addition to this the `options` parameter allows developers to check additional criteria as documented under [SystemDoneConfig](../reference.md#object-systemdoneconfig).

Note: [AutoTest.waitForSystemDone](#classmethod-autotestwaitforsystemdone) will poll this method repeatedly to check for all pending actions being complete. The [SystemWaitConfig](../reference.md#object-systemwaitconfig) parameter of that method allow the user to speciofy which actions to wait for. By default [AutoTest.waitForSystemDone](#classmethod-autotestwaitforsystemdone) will wait for _all_ actions to complete, including queued redraws, timers, network requests, as well as page load and comopnent level `is_Component_Done` checks.

Depending on your application configuration, it is possible that this method will not be able to determine whether it is truly in a busy state. Some examples include:

*   If [SystemDoneConfig.includeTimers](SystemDoneConfig.md#attr-systemdoneconfigincludetimers) is true and the application has a constantly running background timer to perform some ongoing polling action or similar, this method may return `false` even though the application is ready for interaction
*   Similarly if [SystemDoneConfig.includeRedraws](SystemDoneConfig.md#attr-systemdoneconfigincluderedraws) is true, and the application is using messaging, or some other mechanism to periodically refresh component(s) such that they are repeatedly marked as dirty, this method may return `false` even though the application is ready for interaction
*   If this application makes use of some third-party library to perform asynchronous actions, this method may return `true` even when the application is waiting on a response from this third-party tool.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| options | [SystemDoneConfig](#type-systemdoneconfig)|[boolean](../reference.md#type-boolean) | true | — | This parameter determines what specific outstanding actions are required to be completed before the system is considered "done" with current processing. If passed as a boolean rather than a SystemDoneConfig object, this determines whether the system should wait for [pending redraws](Canvas.md#method-canvasmarkforredraw). |
| includeEdits | [Boolean](#type-boolean) | true | — | whether to check for unsaved edits for ListGrids. _Note the includeEdits parameter is deprecated and may be removed in the future._ |

### Returns

`[boolean](../reference.md#type-boolean)` — whether loaded page is 'done' as described above

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.waitForElement

### Description
Waits for any in-progress actions to complete and then returns the element for the specified locator.

By default this method will wait for the [system to be done](#classmethod-autotestissystemdone) before calling [AutoTest.getElement](#classmethod-autotestgetelement) with the specified locator. The [waitStyle](../reference.md#attr-elementwaitconfigwaitstyle) attribute of the options parameter may be used to instead wait for the locator to resolve to a [clickable element](#classmethod-autotestiselementclickable).

| locator | [AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator) | false | — | locator for the element to retrieve |
| callback | [Callback](../reference.md#type-callback) | false | — | callback to fire when the element has been retrieved - takes two parameters:

*   "element" ([DOMElement](../reference_2.md#object-domelement)) - the clickable element the locator resolved to (or null)
*   "done" (boolean) - this will be false if the method timed out |
| options | [ElementWaitConfig](#type-elementwaitconfig) | true | — | Options to configure the wait |

---
## ClassMethod: AutoTest.isElementClickable

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.waitForSystemDone

### Description
Fires the provided callback when [AutoTest.isSystemDone](#classmethod-autotestissystemdone) returns true.

By default this will wait for the following system actions to complete:

*   All outstanding SmartClient [RPC and DataSource requests](RPCManager.md#class-rpcmanager)
*   All outstanding [FileLoader requests](../reference_2.md#object-fileloader)
*   Any [queued redraws](Canvas.md#method-canvasmarkforredraw)
*   Any non-recurring [delayed actions](Timer.md#class-timer)

Note that this behavior may differ from the default settings for [AutoTest.isSystemDone](#classmethod-autotestissystemdone)

The `options` parameter gives developers finer grained control over what to wait for.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| callback | [Callback](../reference.md#type-callback) | false | — | Action to fire. This will take a single parameter "done" which will be set to false if the method timed out waiting for isSystemDone() to return true; |
| options | [SystemWaitConfig](#type-systemwaitconfig) | true | — | options to configure the wait |

---
## ClassMethod: AutoTest.getPageCoords

### Description
Returns the page-level coordinates corresponding to the supplied locator. Note: The physical position might change due to app redesign, but these coordinates would still reflect the same logical part of the DOM element for components where event position matters.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| locator | [AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator) | false | — | Locator String previously returned by [AutoTest.getLocator](#classmethod-autotestgetlocator) |

### Returns

`[Array](#type-array)` — X, Y page position

### Groups

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.getLocator

### Description
Returns the [AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator) associated with some DOM element in a SmartClient application page. If coords, representing the page position, is passed in, the locator may be generated with a specific trailing "target area" identifer that will map back to the appropriate, potentially different, physical coordinates, even if the widget is moved. The coords argument will only have an effect in cases where the mouse position over the target could potentially change behavior.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| DOMElement | [DOMElement](#type-domelement) | false | — | DOM element within in the page. If null the locator for the last mouse event target will be generated |
| checkForNativeHandling | [boolean](../reference.md#type-boolean) | true | — | If this parameter is passed in, check whether the target element responds to native browser events directly rather than going through the SmartClient widget/event handling model. If we detect this case, return null rather than a live locator. This allows us to differentiate between (for example) an event on a Canvas handle, and an event occurring directly on a simple ``<a href=...>`` tag written inside a Canvas handle. |
| coords | [Array](#type-array) | true | — | X, Y page position |

### Returns

`[AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator)` — Locator string allowing the AutoTest subsystem to find an equivalent DOM element on subsequent page loads.

### Groups

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.getValue

### Description
Given an [AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator) that refers to a live SmartClient object or a logical subcomponent of that object, return the associated meaningful JS value, if any.

For example:

*   For a locator to a ListGrid/CubeGrid cell, return the cell's value
*   For a locator to a FormItem, return the FormItem's value
*   For a locator to a ListGrid field header, return the checkbox/sorting state
*   For a locator to a Calendar EventCanvas header or body, return the text

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| locator | [AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator) | false | — | Locator String previously returned by [AutoTest.getLocator](#classmethod-autotestgetlocator) |

### Returns

`[Object](../reference.md#type-object)` — value associated with SC object if any, otherwise undefined

### Groups

- autoTest

---
## ClassMethod: AutoTest.getMinimalLocator

### Description
Returns a locator that's optimized to have minimal length while still trying to robustly represent that targeted canvas. The returned locator may simply be an ID, if the target has a manually assigned ID, or it may consist of syntax starting with `//:` that will search for a widget with the specified ID or defining property (e.g. "title"). A minimal locator may also contain a second, interior search denoted by `//` that searches the hierarchy below the preceding part of the locator.

A minimal locator should be passed to [AutoTest.getObject](#classmethod-autotestgetobject), [AutoTest.getElement](#classmethod-autotestgetelement), etc., to retrieve the original target.

Note that when searching by defining property, a breadth-first search of the widget hierarchy will be run looking for the first widget of the appropriate framework class with the specified defining property.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Optional | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| DOMElement | [DOMElement](#type-domelement) | false | — | DOM element within in the page. If null the locator for the last mouse event target will be generated |
| checkForNativeHandling | [boolean](../reference.md#type-boolean) | true | — | If this parameter is passed in, check whether the target element responds to native browser events directly rather than going through the SmartClient widget/event handling model. If we detect this case, return null rather than a live locator. This allows us to differentiate between (for example) an event on a Canvas handle, and an event occurring directly on a simple ``<a href=...>`` tag written inside a Canvas handle. |
| coords | [Array](#type-array) | true | — | X, Y page position |

### Returns

`[AutoTestLocator](../reference_2.md#type-autotestlocator)` — minimal locator string allowing the AutoTest subsystem to find an equivalent DOM element on subsequent page loads.

*   page has finished loading
*   if a [TextItem](TextItem.md#class-textitem), [FileItem](FileItem.md#class-fileitem), or [TextAreaItem](TextAreaItem.md#class-textareaitem), it has native focus,
*   the element satisfies [AutoTest.isElementClickable](#classmethod-autotestiselementclickable)

### Parameters

## ClassMethod: AutoTest.installLocatorShortcut

### Description
This method allows developers to retrieve locators for elements on the page via a key-combo plus mouseDown on the element in question.  
It may be invoked from a bookmarklet stored in the browser, giving developers a one-click way to retrieve locators for any SmartClient application

When installLocatorShortcut() is invoked, it will register a Page-level `mouseDown` handler which, if the Shift+Ctrl or Shift+Meta key-combo are being held down will display the locator for the element under the mouse in a text-box and also copy it to clipboard.

As with the [isc.showConsole()](../kb_topics/debugging.md#kb-topic-debugging) method, developers may wish to create a bookmark in their browser to quickly enable this functionality on any SmartClient application, without any changes to the application code:

1.  Create a new bookmark in your browser.
2.  Enter url "javascript:isc.AutoTest.installLocatorShortcut()".
3.  Label the bookmark as "Locator Shortcut"
4.  Consider adding this to the Bookmarks Toolbar. This allows you to enable the feature with a single click from any SmartClient application.

To uninstall the locator shortcut, call [AutoTest.uninstallLocatorShortcut](#classmethod-autotestuninstalllocatorshortcut)
