## Type: AutoTestLocator

### Description
An AutoTestLocator is a string generated by the [AutoTest](classes/AutoTest.md#class-autotest) class to reliably identify an interactive element in a SmartClient application. Locators allow integration with automated testing tools. For an overview of automated testing in SmartClient, see the documentation topic [here](kb_topics/automatedTesting.md#kb-topic-automated-testing).

AutoTestLocators are designed to work across browsers, SmartClient versions, and even major changes to your application's UI. They do not rely on the DOM structure, and are intended to be able to identify the target element reliably without requiring pervasive explicitly specified [component IDs](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasid).

The [AutoTest](classes/AutoTest.md#class-autotest) class is responsible for creating locator strings corresponding to DOM elements, SmartClient components or other objects, and for resolving locators back to those objects at runtime.

A locator for an element may be retrieved via [AutoTest.getLocator](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetlocator), or by using the [locator shortcut tool](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestinstalllocatorshortcut), or the _"Show AutoTest Locators"_ link on the _Results_ tab of the SmartClient [Developer Console](kb_topics/debugging.md#kb-topic-debugging).

Stored locators may be resolved to target elements via [AutoTest.getElement](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetelement) (or resolved to target objects via [AutoTest.getObject](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetobject)).

**Best Practices for building applications with reliable locators**

Developers should be aware of certain considerations that can make generated AutoTestLocators more reliable when designing their application.

The [reliableLocators](kb_topics/reliableLocators.md#kb-topic-generating-reliable-autotestlocators) overview topic covers general recommendations to ensure that AutoTestLocators are robust and reliable within your app.

The [portableAutoTests](kb_topics/portableAutoTests.md#kb-topic-writing-autotests-for-multiple-environments) topic discusses considerations around recording and playing back test scripts over different environments with changes to data or user interface, and the capabilities SmartClient offers to address these considerations.

## Type: CacheSyncStrategy

### Description
Indicates the strategy to be used for [automatic cache synchronization](kb_topics/cacheSynchronization.md#kb-topic-automatic-cache-synchronization), for a given [DataSource](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcecachesyncstrategy), [OperationBinding](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingcachesyncstrategy) or [DSRequest](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestcachesyncstrategy).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "refetch" | Obtain cache sync values by refetching the record we just updated or added. If the DataSource contains [primary key fields](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcegetprimarykeyfields) of type `sequence`, the framework will first attempt to obtain values for those fields - see [sequenceMode](#type-sequencemode).

This is the most complete and foolproof way to get cache sync data, because we pick up any changes to the record that were applied by the persistence layer - for example database default values, values applied by database triggers or transformations applied to the record we sent by a remote REST service or legacy program call. However, it is also the least performant, since it involves a full refetch of the data. This is the default strategy for [SQL DataSources](kb_topics/sqlDataSource.md#kb-topic-sql-datasources) and [custom DataSources](kb_topics/writeCustomDataSource.md#kb-topic-custom-server-datasources). It is also the strategy used for [Hibernate](kb_topics/hibernateIntegration.md#kb-topic-integration-with-hibernate) and [JPA](kb_topics/jpaIntegration.md#kb-topic-integration-with-jpa) DataSources, though for these two, it is implemented inherently by the ORM system and you should not attempt to change it. See the [cache synchronization overview](kb_topics/cacheSynchronization.md#kb-topic-automatic-cache-synchronization) for details |
| "requestValuesPlusSequences" | Obtain cache sync values by merging the request values on top of the request's [oldValues](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestoldvalues). If the DataSource contains [primary key fields](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcegetprimarykeyfields) of type `sequence`, the framework will then attempt to obtain values for those fields - see [sequenceMode](#type-sequencemode) - and merge those values into the cache sync data as well. This strategy avoids a data refetch, which may be a significant performance gain (though please see the note in the `sequenceMode` documentation regarding Oracle as a special case in this regard). Despite the name, this strategy is also suitable and effective for situations where your keys are not sequences - for example, when they are GUIDs or when they are user-entered codes. In this case, we simply do not attempt to resolve sequence values, and since the key values are already included in the request values, everything works

Note, if no `oldValues` are available and the updated record is [incomplete](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcesparseupdates), or if the combination of `oldValues` and values is missing a value for a [required field](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldrequired) for any other reason, this strategy will return incomplete cache sync data. For details of what we do in these circumstances, see the "CacheSyncStrategy" section of the [cache synchronization overview](kb_topics/cacheSynchronization.md#kb-topic-automatic-cache-synchronization) |
| "responseValues" | This strategy simply returns the data returned by the add or update operation, as the cache sync data. This only makes sense for `DataSource` types that return a value for an update operation. This may include generic DataSources and `RestConnector`s, depending entirely on what the implementation returns. It specifically does not include [SQL DataSources](kb_topics/sqlDataSource.md#kb-topic-sql-datasources), because SQL/JDBC update operations do not return a value (other than the number of affected records).

This is the default strategy for [RestConnector](kb_topics/serverRestConnector.md#kb-topic-server-side-rest-connector)s, because it was the default way we did cache sync for that DataSource type before `CacheSyncStrategy` was introduced (and also because it is the ideal strategy for REST services that return the record-as-updated). See [DataSource.cacheSyncStrategy](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcecachesyncstrategy) for details of how to change the default strategy for a given dataSource type. |
| "none" | This strategy does not attempt to derive cache sync data at all. No response data is sent back to the caller, and the response is marked for [cache invalidation](classes/DSResponse.md#attr-dsresponseinvalidatecache) |

## Type: CacheSyncTiming

### Description
Indicates the timing strategy to be used for [automatic cache synchronization](kb_topics/cacheSynchronization.md#kb-topic-automatic-cache-synchronization), for a given [DataSource](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcecachesynctiming), [OperationBinding](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingcachesynctiming) or [DSRequest](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestcachesynctiming). This property controls the "when" of cache synchronization; the "how" is controlled by [CacheSyncStrategy](reference_2.md#type-cachesyncstrategy).

**NOTE:** `CacheSyncTiming` is intended to allow applications to defer cache synchronization to the point where response data is actually requested; the primary aim of this is to avoid doing cache sync altogether in cases where the response data is never requested. There are some mainstream types of request where we know that the response data unequivocally _is_ required, and for these requests a global default `CacheSyncTiming` will be overridden to "immediate" by SmartClient because there is no point in deferring cache sync when we know for sure it will eventually be needed. Thus, cache sync will always run immediately regardless of the default `cacheSyncTiming` setting in these cases:

*   Requests sent from a client
*   Server-created requests that copy an `RPCManager` across from a client-originated request, either by specifying it in the `DSRequest` constructor, or by calling `dsRequest.setRPCManager()`

The above only applies to the global default `cacheSyncTiming`: a `cacheSyncTiming` set explicitly at the [DataSource](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcecachesynctiming), [operation](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingcachesynctiming) or [request](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestcachesynctiming) level will usually be honored. However, even an explicit `cacheSyncTiming` setting on the DataSource, operation or request will be ignored in situations where it could break a framework feature if we honored it. These situations are:

*   Requests where [automatic auditing](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceaudit) is in force
*   Requests on a dataSource with one-to-many or many-to-many relations, where the update means that SmartClient must update foreign keys on the related dataSources to maintain relation integrity

In both these cases, we cannot allow the cache sync to be deferred because it is possible that a deferred cache sync fetch would never be invoked - indeed, that is the whole point of allowing cache sync to be deferred - and in that case, key processes would fail to run.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "immediate" | Obtain cache sync values immediately after the update operation returns |
| "lazy" | Defer running cache sync until the first time `getData()` is called on the server-side `DSResponse`. As described above, the point of deferring cache sync is to avoid running it at all in cases where nothing needs the response data (and thus nothing calls `getData()`). In addition to the above-listed cases where we know that cache sync is _always_ going to be required, there are other cases where `getData()` will be called, even if your application code doesn't do so. Some examples:

*   If logging levels are set such that the framework is logging response data
*   If you have a [multiple](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldmultiple) field in your dataSource and its value requires transformation because of [multipleStorage](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldmultiplestorage) or [transformMultipleFields](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcetransformmultiplefields) settings

In these cases, and others where the response data is required, the cache sync process will be deferred to later in the process, but it will run. |

## Type: CellRecordMode

### Description
When [canSelectCells](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgridcanselectcells) is true, whether [getSelection()](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridgetselection) on a [DataBoundComponent](#interface-databoundcomponent) or individual [CellSelection](classes/CellSelection.md#class-cellselection) should return one record per selected cell, as with [CubeGrid](classes/CubeGrid.md#class-cubegrid), or one record per row that has any selected cells, as with [ListGrid](classes/ListGrid_1.md#class-listgrid).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "cell" | getSelection returns one record for each selected cell via [getCellRecord()](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridgetcellrecord) |
| "row" | getSelection returns distinct records for each row with one or more selected cells |

### Groups

## Type: ClientUniquenessCheckCondition

### Description
For a validator of type `isUnique` in a component listing multiple records such as a ListGrid, can we use the component's fetched data set to check for uniqueness? Used by [Validator.checkComponentData](classes/Validator.md#attr-validatorcheckcomponentdata).

It is possible to check for uniqueness against a ListGrid's data set and "shortcut" the validation process in a couple of cases:

*   If the grid has a complete data set from the DataSource, we can determine whether a record is unique or not by examining that data without ever querying the DataSource.
*   Even if the grid is only displaying a partial data set from the DataSource, if the user-entered value collides with another loaded record's value, we can assert that the value is **not** unique.  
    However, if the data set is not complete we can only shortcut validation when we find a collision. If we don't find a loaded record with a matching value, the DataSource will still need to be queried to definitively determine whether the value is unique.

Note that component data will **only** be consulted if the component is bound to a dataSource and has its data object set to a [ResultSet](classes/ResultSet.md#class-resultset). Additionally, with the exception of the special `"forceBoth"` setting, component data will only be used to determine uniqueness if the following conditions are met:

*   The default fetch operation was used (e.g listGrid.fetchOperation has not been set)
*   The data object was automatically created by the component [while fetching data](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridfetchdata), as opposed to manually instantiated by the application developer. This is because with a hand-created ResultSet, you could provide any set of records you want, so we don't know if they are an exact match for the default fetch operation on the DataSource.

Also note that, as with any validator understood by the server, uniqueness checking will always be enforced on the server as part of a save operation once data is committed.  
The `checkComponentData` setting simply allows developers to optimize performance by catching duplicate values on the client before the save operation is sent to the server, or avoid hitting the server at all during [validation without saving](classes/DynamicForm.md#method-dynamicformvalidate) in cases where this is possible.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "none" | Never consult cached component data. Uniqueness checking will be performed directly against the dataSource data set only. |
| "earlyFailOnly" | If the component has a partial or complete data cache that meets the conditions outlined above, check for another existing record in the cache with an identical field value. If one is found, the validator will fail on the client. If no match is found, standard validation will proceed against the dataSource's full data set. |
| "both" | If the component has a [complete data cache](classes/ResultSet.md#method-resultsetallrowscached) that meets the conditions outlined above, uniqueness checking will be performed against this data set only rather than querying the dataSource to check for uniqueness. |
| "forceBoth" | _\[Advanced Setting\]_ As with `checkComponentData:"both"`, if a component has a [complete data cache](classes/ResultSet.md#method-resultsetallrowscached), uniqueness checking will be peformed against this data set instead of querying the dataSource. However unlike `checkComponentData:"both"`, the `"forceBoth"` setting enables this behavior even if the component's data object has a custom fetch operation specified, or was created explicitly by application code instead of being automatically created as part of the standard `fetchData()` flow. |

## Type: Constant

### Description
A string used to define the value of a class attribute when it's referenced as one of the potential values of an enum type. For example, one documented value of [Overflow](#type-overflow) is [Canvas.HIDDEN](classes/Canvas.md#classattr-canvashidden), which is itself a class attribute with type `Constant` and the value "hidden".

---
## Type: ContentsType

### Description
What type of content is being displayed within the [HTMLFlow](classes/HTMLFlow.md#class-htmlflow)? This content may come from the [contentsURL](classes/HTMLFlow.md#attr-htmlflowcontentsurl) or be directly specified as [HTMLFlow.contents](classes/HTMLFlow.md#attr-htmlflowcontents).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "page" | The HTML content is treated as a standalone document and displayed in an isolated context using an IFRAME. |
| "fragment" | The HTML content is treated as a snippet designed to integrate into the main page and is directly inserted into the DOM. |

### See Also

- [HTMLFlow.contentsType](classes/HTMLFlow.md#attr-htmlflowcontentstype)

---
## Type: Criteria

### Description
Criteria for selecting only a matching set of records from a DataSource. Criteria can be applied on the client and server. Unless configured otherwise, criteria will generally be applied client-side by [ResultSet](classes/ResultSet.md#class-resultset)s via [ResultSet.applyFilter](classes/ResultSet.md#method-resultsetapplyfilter).

Client- and server-side systems built into SmartClient understand two criteria formats by default: simple key-value pairs (Criteria) or the [AdvancedCriteria](#object-advancedcriteria) format.

Simple key-value Criteria are represented via a JavaScript Object where each property specifies the name and required value for a field. Multiple legal values for a field can be provided as an Array. For example:

```
 var criteria = {
    field1 : "value1",
    field2 : ["value2", "value3"]
 }
 
```
Would select all records where field1 has value "value1" and where field2 has _either_ "value2" or "value3".

Use [DataSource.combineCriteria](classes/DataSource.md#classmethod-datasourcecombinecriteria) to combine two Criteria objects (including Criteria and AdvancedCriteria) or [DataSource.convertCriteria](classes/DataSource.md#classmethod-datasourceconvertcriteria) to convert simple Criteria to the AdvancedCriteria format.

When writing custom client and server-side filtering logic, criteria must be a JavaScript Object but the properties of that Object can contain whatever data you want. When sent to the SmartClient server, the Java representation of the criteria is described [here](classes/RPCRequest.md#attr-rpcrequestdata). When sent to other servers, the [operationBinding.dataProtocol](reference_2.md#type-dsprotocol) affects the format.

### See Also

## Type: CriteriaCombineOperator

### Description
The logical operator to use when combining criteria objects with the [DataSource.combineCriteria](classes/DataSource.md#classmethod-datasourcecombinecriteria) method.

## Type: CriteriaPolicy

### Description

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "dropOnChange" | Cache is dropped whenever criteria changes. |
| "dropOnShortening" | Cache is retained as long as the only changes to criteria make the criteria more restrictive as determined by [ResultSet.compareCriteria](classes/ResultSet.md#method-resultsetcomparecriteria). |

---
## Type: CSSColor

### Description
CSS color specification applied to a specific HTML element on this page.

This is a string matching the syntax as specified in CSS1, and can be formatted in one of the following ways:

*   A keyword color, “white”
*   Six-digit hex notation, “#ffffff”
*   Three-digit hex notation, “#fff”
*   8-bit decimal notation, “rgb(255, 255, 255)”
*   Percentage notation, “rgb(100%, 100%, 100%)”

Note that when working with [FacetChart](classes/FacetChart.md#class-facetchart)s, it's required that colors be specified using the six-digit hex format listed above, rather than any of the others, since the Framework needs to perform math on the subfields. Affected properties include [FacetChart.dataColors](classes/FacetChart.md#attr-facetchartdatacolors), and affected methods include overrides of [FacetChart.getDataColor](classes/FacetChart.md#method-facetchartgetdatacolor) and [FacetChart.getDataLineColor](classes/FacetChart.md#method-facetchartgetdatalinecolor).

|-------|-------------|
| "straight" | simple straight lines between points that are adjacent in the dataset |
| "smooth" | smooth spline curve between points that are adjacent in the dataset |

---
## Type: DataPath

### Description
String specifying a nested data field structure.

**NOTE: the dataPath feature is intended to help certain legacy architectures, such as systems that work in terms of exchanging large messages with several different entity types in one message, and are incapable of providing separate access to each entity type. Don't use dataPath if this is not your situation.**

_If you are not forced by legacy issues to use hierarchical data structures, we recommend:_

_*   If a subobject exists just to bundle several related fields together, and is not a separate entity (cannot be separately created or separately referenced by other objects), "flatten" the fields using features such as [DataSourceField.valueXPath](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldvaluexpath).
*   If a subobject is actually a separate entity, make a DataSource for it and use operations on that DataSource to load and modify it.
    
    For example, when representing a sales order with a "deliveryAddress" (consisting of multiple fields), you'd typically want an "orders" dataSource to define the fields for the order as a whole, and an "address" dataSource to define the structure of the deliveryAddress object.
    
    It may seem like a good idea to work with a single hierarchical order object, where the "deliveryAddress" attribute is set to a sub-object that matches the structure defined in the "address" dataSource. DataPaths could be used to extract individual address fields for editing in a form alongside other fields from the order, and edits would be saved via a simple "add" or "update" operation, passing in the modified nested data object.
    
    In fact, this has a number of disadvantages. Since there is no call to the "update" operation on the "address" subobject, the address will be modified without the normal features of a dataSource update. You can't specify [security rules](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcerequiresauthentication), [DMI](kb_topics/dmiOverview.md#kb-topic-direct-method-invocation) logic, [request modifiers](reference_2.md#object-dsrequestmodifier), and no logging or [auditing](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceaudit) will run.  
    The same "bypassing" problem occurs, in perhaps worse form, if a subobject does not yet exist and the framework creates it automatically, skipping a DataSource "add" operation that may have established defaults, not been allowed for the user, etc.
    
    Loading and saving nested data objects as a single hierarchical block also offers no advantages in terms of performance or simplicity.  
    The [queuing](classes/RPCManager.md#classmethod-rpcmanagerstartqueue) system makes it extremely easy to load and save multiple types of entities in a single HTTP request, and takes far less code to implement properly as multiple DataSource operations, with equivalent or better performance.
    
    Loading arrays of related objects (such as all LineItems in an Order) as a hierarchical object has the further drawback that paging cannot be used for the list of related objects, and all such objects will not participate in [automatic cache synchronization](classes/ResultSet.md#class-resultset).
    _

_In short, we do not recommend structuring your data as a hierarchy of nested data objects and using dataPath to navigate these structures unless you are forced to by a legacy system that doesn't allow separate operations on each entity type._

**How to use dataPaths**

Each dataPath string is a slash-delimited set of field identifiers, for example `"id1/id2/id3"`. DataPaths may be applied directly to a [component](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasdatapath), and/or to a databound component field specification. A datapath denotes a path to a nested field value in a hierarchical structure, giving developers the opportunity to easily view or edit nested data structures. Specifically:

*   if the component is viewing or editing a record, the value for fields will be derived from a nested structure of records
*   if the component is bound to a dataSource, field attributes may be picked up by following the dataPath to a field definition on another dataSource

**Examples:**  
If a dynamicForm is defined with the following fields:
```
    [
      { name:"name" },
      { name:"street", dataPath:"address/street" }
    ]
 
```
If the `"name"` field is set to _"Joe Smith"_ and the `"street"` field is set to _"1221 High Street"_, when the values for this form are retrieved via a `getValues()` call they will return an object in the following format:
```
    {name:"Joe Smith", address:{street:"1221 High Street"}}
 
```

For databound components, dataPath also provides a way to pick up field attributes from nested dataSources. Given the following dataSource definitions:

```
  isc.DataSource.create({
      ID:"contacts",
      fields:[
          {name:"name"},
          {name:"email"},
          {name:"organization"},
          {name:"phone"},
          {name:"address", type:"Address"}
      ]
  });
 
  isc.DataSource.create({
      ID:"Address",
      fields:[
          {name:"street"},
          {name:"city"},
          {name:"state"},
          {name:"zip"}
      ]
  });
  
```
and a databound component bound to the 'contacts' dataSource, specifying a field with a dataPath of `"address/street"` would ensure the field attributes were derived from the "street" field of the 'Address' dataSource.

dataPaths are also cumulative. In other words if a component has a specified dataPath, the dataPath of any fields it contains will be appended to that component level path when accessing data. For example the following form:

```
 isc.DynamicForm.create({
     dataPath:"contact",
     fields:[
          {dataPath:"address/email"}
     ]
 });
 
```
Might be used to edit a data structure similar to this:
```
{contact:{name:'Ed Jones', address:{state:"CA", email:"ed@ed.jones.com"}}}
```
Nested canvases can also have dataPaths specified, which will similarly be combined. See the [Canvas.dataPath](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasdatapath) attribute for more information and examples of this.

## Type: DataSourceTemplateReferenceMode

### Description
Indicates the mode to use for resolving templated references in a DataSource's configuration file. See [DataSource.allowTemplateReferences](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceallowtemplatereferences) for an overview of configuration templating.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "none" | Indicates that no resolution of templated references should be done |
| "configOnly" | Indicates that a simple find-and-replace process should resolve templated references. In this mode, the system looks for references strictly like the one below, and replaces them with the referenced property from your `server.properties` file. So if your `server.properties` file contained an entry like this:
```
     database.name: MyDatabase
 
```
the below example would cause `dbName` to be resolved as `MyDatabase`
```
     dbName="$config['database.name']"
 
```
(Note, you can use a different token than "`$config`" if you need to - see [templateConfigToken](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcetemplateconfigtoken)) |
| "all" | Indicates that full Velocity processing will be used to resolve templated references. This allows you to use all of Velocity's template-handling features - for example, conditional blocks and iteration - and so is more powerful than the simple "configOnly" option above. Note, however, that this templating is necessarily limited by the fact that it takes place during DataSource initialization, when there is not a lot of context available for templating purposes - you have the "`$config`" object, as with "configOnly", and some of the other variables listed in the [Velocity overview](kb_topics/velocitySupport.md#kb-topic-velocity-context-variables), but nothing relating to [DSRequest](reference_2.md#object-dsrequest)s |

## Type: DragAppearance

### Description
Different types of effects for showing dragging behavior.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "none" | No default drag appearance is indicated. Your custom dragging routines should implement some behavior that indicates that the user is in a dragging situation, and where the mouse is. |
| "tracker" | A "drag tracker" object is automatically shown and moved around with the mouse. This is generally set to an icon that represents what is being dragged. The default tracker is a 10 pixel black square, but you can customize this icon. This dragAppearance is not recommended for use with drag resizing or drag moving. |

---
## Type: DSCallback

### Description
A [Callback](#type-callback) to evaluate when a DataSource request completes.

The parameters available in the DSCallback expression are:

*   dsResponse: a [DSResponse](classes/DSResponse.md#class-dsresponse) instance with metadata about the returned data
*   data: data returned to satisfy the DataSource request. See the [DataSource operations](kb_topics/dataSourceOperations.md#kb-topic-datasource-operations) topic for expected results for each type of DataSource operation
*   dsRequest: the [DSRequest](reference_2.md#object-dsrequest) that was sent. You can use [DSRequest.clientContext](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestclientcontext) to track state during the server turnaround.

For example, if you had a DynamicForm with ID "myForm" and you wanted to retrieve a record from a DataSource "myUsers", where each record has a "userId" field:
```
     myUsers.fetchData({ userId : "fred" }, "myForm.setValues(data)");
 
```
or
```
     myUsers.fetchData({ userId : "fred" }, function (dsResponse, data, dsRequest) {
                                              myForm.setValues(data);
                                            });
 
```

Note that if the request encounters a low-level error (such as 500 server error), by default the callback will **not** be fired, instead, [DataSource.handleError](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcehandleerror) is called to invoke the default system-wide error handling. Set [willHandleError](classes/RPCRequest.md#attr-rpcrequestwillhandleerror):true to have your callback invoked regardless of whether there are errors, however, make sure your callback properly handles malformed responses when [DSResponse.status](classes/DSResponse.md#attr-dsresponsestatus) is non-zero.

---
## Type: DSDataFormat

### Description
Indicates the format to be used for HTTP requests and responses when fulfilling DSRequests (eg, when [DataSource.fetchData](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcefetchdata) is called).

Note that [request queuing](classes/RPCManager.md#classmethod-rpcmanagerstartqueue) is only available for "iscServer" requests.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "iscServer" | Make an HTTP request in a format recognized by the ISC server and expect ISC server response format. [Server-side integration](kb_topics/serverDataIntegration.md#kb-topic-server-datasource-integration) can then be used to connect to any kind of data store or web service. |
| "xml" | Expect XML responses. Request format depends on the setting for [protocol](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingdataprotocol). This is the correct setting when consuming RSS feeds, XML web services (whether SOAP, REST, XML-RPC or custom format), and XML flat files directly from the browser.

Values for "date", "time" or "datetime" fields in responses should be specified in the applicable [XML Schema date format](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime). If no timezone is explicitly specified, dates / datetimes received by the client are assumed to be GMT. Note that "date" type fields represent logical dates and may omit time information entirely, and "time" type fields may omit date information. See [Date and Time Format and storage](kb_topics/dateFormatAndStorage.md#kb-topic-date-and-time-format-and-storage) for more information on how date values are serialized in requests sent to the server.

A DSResponse will be derived from the returned XML via the process described under [DataSource.transformResponse](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcetransformresponse). |
| "json" | Expect response in JSON [(Java Script Object Notation)](http://json.org) format, ready to be eval()'d. Response should either be a naked object literal:
```
     { "property":"value1", "property2" : "value2", ... }
 
```
or a string that evals to return a valid response object:
```
     var response = { "property":"value1", "property2" : "value2", ... }
     response;
 
```

A DSResponse will be derived from the returned JSON via the process described under [DataSource.transformResponse](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcetransformresponse).

As with `"xml"` responses, values for "date" or "datetime" fields should be specified as a String in [XML Schema date format](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime) and may include a timezone. In the absence of a timezone they will be assumed to be GMT.

Request format depends on the setting for [protocol](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingdataprotocol). See also [XJSONDataSource](classes/XJSONDataSource.md#class-xjsondatasource). |
| "custom" | SmartClient will not attempt to parse the response, instead, [DataSource.transformResponse](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcetransformresponse) must be implemented. `transformResponse` will receive the "data" parameter as a String, and must parse this String into an Array of Objects, which should be set as [DSResponse.data](classes/DSResponse.md#attr-dsresponsedata). Request format depends on the setting for [protocol](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingdataprotocol).

Note that, unlike either the "json" or "xml" settings of `dataFormat`, you are responsible for ensuring that parsed values are the correct type, for example, using the JavaScript built-ins `parseInt` and `parseFloat` on integer and decimal values respectively, and using `new Date()` to construct valid Dates. |

## Type: DSProtocol

### Description
[OperationBinding.dataProtocol](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingdataprotocol) affects how the data in the DSRequest ([DSRequest.data](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestdata)) is sent to the [DataSource.dataURL](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcedataurl). Listed below are the valid values for [OperationBinding.dataProtocol](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingdataprotocol) and their behavior.

Note that, when using the SmartClient server, data is automatically translated from JavaScript to Java according to the rules described [here](classes/RPCRequest.md#attr-rpcrequestdata); dataProtocol does not apply and is ignored.

If you are integrating with a [REST](classes/RestDataSource.md#class-restdatasource) server that requires the more obscure [RPCRequest.httpMethod](classes/RPCRequest.md#attr-rpcrequesthttpmethod)s of "PUT", "DELETE" or "HEAD", you can specify these httpMethod settings via [OperationBinding.requestProperties](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingrequestproperties). dataProtocol settings that mention "GET" or "POST" are compatible with these additional HTTP methods as well. Typical [operationBindings](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceoperationbindings) for a REST server that uses "PUT" and "DELETE" are as follows:

```
    operationBindings:[
       {operationType:"fetch", dataProtocol:"getParams"},
       {operationType:"add", dataProtocol:"postParams"},
       {operationType:"remove", dataProtocol:"getParams", requestProperties:{httpMethod:"DELETE"}},
       {operationType:"update", dataProtocol:"postParams", requestProperties:{httpMethod:"PUT"}}
    ],
 
```

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "getParams" | Data is added to the dataURL, with each property in the data becoming an HTTP parameter, eg http://service.com/search?keyword=foo |
| "postParams" | Data is POST'd to the dataURL, with each property becoming an HTTP parameter, exactly as an HTML form would submit them if it had one input field per property in the data. |
| "postJSON" | Data is serialized as a JSON string and POST'd to the dataURL. |
| "postXML" | Data is serialized as XML via [DataSource.xmlSerialize](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcexmlserialize) and POST'd as the HTTP request body with contentType "text/xml". |
| "soap" | Data is serialized as XML via [DataSource.xmlSerialize](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcexmlserialize), wrapped in a SOAP envelope, and POST'd as the HTTP request body with contentType "text/xml". Generally only used in connection with a [WSDL web service](kb_topics/wsdlBinding.md#kb-topic-wsdl-binding). |
| "postMessage" | dsRequest.data is assumed to be a String set up by [DataSource.transformRequest](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcetransformrequest) and is POST'd as the HTTP request body. |
| "clientCustom" | This setting entirely bypasses the SmartClient comm system. Instead of the DataSource sending an HTTP request to a URL, the developer is expected to implement [DataSource.transformRequest](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcetransformrequest) to perform their own custom logic, and then call [DataSource.processResponse](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourceprocessresponse) to handle the results of this action. This `dataProtocol` setting can be used to implement access to in-browser resources such as HTML5 "localStorage", native APIs available to applications [packaged as native applications](kb_topics/mobileDevelopment.md#kb-topic-mobile-application-development), or to implement the [DataSource Facade pattern](kb_topics/dsFacade.md#kb-topic-datasource-facade-pattern). |

## Type: DSServerType

### Description
Indicates what SmartClient Server will do with a DataSource request if you call dsRequest.execute() in server code.

If you use a Java-based persistence layer not provided by SmartClient, such as EJB or your own custom object model, you don't need to set `dataSource.serverType` and should follow the [integration instructions](kb_topics/serverDataIntegration.md#kb-topic-server-datasource-integration).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "sql" | Use SmartClient's [built-in SQL connectors](kb_topics/sqlDataSource.md#kb-topic-sql-datasources) to talk directly to relational databases. |
| "hibernate" | Use Hibernate, either using a real mapped bean or by automatically generating a Hibernate configuration based on a SmartClient DataSource file (_dataSourceID_.ds.xml). See [hibernateIntegration](kb_topics/hibernateIntegration.md#kb-topic-integration-with-hibernate) for details. |
| "jpa" | Use SmartClient's built-in JPA 2.0 connector. |
| "jpa1" | Use SmartClient's built-in JPA 1.0 connector. |
| "rest" | Use SmartClient's built-in [RestConnector](kb_topics/serverRestConnector.md#kb-topic-server-side-rest-connector), which can connect to many different types of REST webservice |
| "odata" | Use SmartClient's built-in [OData DataSource](kb_topics/odataDataSource.md#kb-topic-server-side-odata-datasource). This is a specialized subclass of the `RestConnector` which adds functionality for REST webservices that follow the [OData protocol](https://www.odata.org/) |
| "generic" | Requests will be delivered to the server and you are expected to write Java code to create a valid response. Throws an error if the server side method dsRequest.execute() is called. This is appropriate if you intend an entirely custom implementation, and you want an error thrown if there is an attempt to call an operation you have not implemented. |
| "projectFile" | Requests will be delivered to the server and processed as [FileSource operations](kb_topics/fileSource.md#kb-topic-filesource-operations), using directories or other DataSources which you configure via [DataSource.projectFileKey](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceprojectfilekey) or [DataSource.projectFileLocations](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceprojectfilelocations) |
| "union" | Use SmartClient's built-in [unionDataSource](kb_topics/unionDataSource.md#kb-topic-union-datasources), which assimilates records from multiple member dataSources |

---
## Type: ElementWaitStyle

### Description
How should [AutoTest.waitForElement](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestwaitforelement) determine that the application is ready to retrieve the element?

Note: In most cases `"system"` is the appropriate setting. This will wait for standard SmartClient-initiated asychronous actions to complete, including timer-instantiated actions such as [delayed redraws](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasmarkforredraw) or actions configured through the [Timer class](classes/Timer.md#class-timer), and oustanding [RPC Requests](classes/RPCManager.md#class-rpcmanager). If the locator cannot be resolved to a clickable element after system quiescence, this usually implies that it will not ever resolve, and there's no need to wait for the timeout to complete and slow down your test suite.

The only time you'd want to use `"element"` would be if your application relies on some asynchronous event that isn't tracked by the SmartClient system. Examples might include waiting for asynchronous actions instantiated by a third-party tool on the page, or waiting for a server notification to come in through the [RealtimeMessaging](kb_topics/messaging.md#kb-topic-real-time-messaging) system.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "system" | use [AutoTest.waitForSystemDone](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestwaitforsystemdone) to wait for actions to complete, then return the result of [AutoTest.getElement](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetelement), even if this method doesn't resolve to an element. |
| "element" | wait until [AutoTest.getElement](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetelement) resolves to an element, and the element is [clickable](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestiselementclickable). |

---
## Type: EmbeddedPosition

### Description
How a component should be embedded within its record or cell

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "expand" | component should be placed underneath normal record or cell content, expanding the records. Expanding records can result in variable height rows, in which case [virtualScrolling](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgridvirtualscrolling) should be enabled. |
| "within" | component should be placed within the normal area of the record or cell. Percentage sizes will be treated as percentages of the record and [Canvas.snapTo](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvassnapto) positioning settings are also allowed and refer to the rectangle of the record or cell. Note that for components embedded within cells, cell align and vAlign will be used if snapTo is unset (so top / left alignment of cell content will map to snapTo of "TL", etc). |

| "string" | Translates to/from a String matching the `enum.toString()`. |
| "ordinal" | Translates to/from an integer matching the ordinal number of the constant within the enumeration |
| "bean" | Translates to/from a Javascript object containing one property for each property defined within the enum. The constant itself and the ordinal number are included in the JS object. By default they are called "\_constant" and "\_ordinal", but this can be overridden with the [DataSource.enumOrdinalProperty](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceenumordinalproperty) and [DataSource.enumConstantProperty](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceenumconstantproperty) properties |

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "key" | The import process expects values in the import dataset to be the real underlying key values, and performs no transformation |
| "display" | The import process expects values in the import dataset to be display values, and it will transform them to the corresponding underlying keys if found |
| "displayRequired" | Same as "display", but results in [validation error](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldimportstrategyfailederrormessage) if corresponding underlying keys were not found |
| "auto" | The import process will attempt to discover the best setting to use, based on the values in the first record, and use that setting for every remaining record in the import dataset |

## Type: FieldType

### Description
The types listed below are built-in types that [databound\\n components](#interface-databoundcomponent) understand and treat specially (using type-specific form controls, validators, formatters, sorting logic, etc).

You can declare custom types via [SimpleType.create()](classes/SimpleType.md#class-simpletype), with settings that will influence DataBound components. You can also create your own subclasses of databound components to add further custom, reusable behaviors based on field.type.

`field.type` can also be the ID of another [DataSource](classes/DataSource.md#class-datasource), which allows you to model nested structures such as XML documents (in fact, [XMLTools.loadXMLSchema](classes/XMLTools.md#classmethod-xmltoolsloadxmlschema) models XML schema in this way). Nested DataSource declarations affect how XML and JSON data is deserialized into JavaScript objects in the [client-side integration](kb_topics/clientDataIntegration.md#kb-topic-client-side-data-integration) pipeline, so that you can load complex XML documents and have them deserialized into a correctly typed nested data structure.

Note: to declare related but _separate_ objects, as in an "Account" object that can be related to both a "Contact" object and "Order" objects, use [DataSourceField.foreignKey](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldforeignkey), **not** a nested structure declaration.

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "text" | Generic text, e.g. `"John Doe"`. This is the default field type. Use `field.length` to set length. |
| "boolean" | A boolean value, e.g. `true` |
| "integer" | A whole number, e.g. `123` |
| "float" | A floating point (decimal) number, e.g. `1.23` |
| "date" | A logical date, with no time value (such as a holiday or birthday). Represented on the client as a JavaScript `Date` object where time values are ignored. See [dateFormatAndStorage](kb_topics/dateFormatAndStorage.md#kb-topic-date-and-time-format-and-storage) for more information on date display and serialization formats. |
| "time" | A time of day, with no date. Represented on the client as a JavaScript `Date` object in UTC/GMT by default (see also [dateFormatAndStorage](kb_topics/dateFormatAndStorage.md#kb-topic-date-and-time-format-and-storage) and the [Time](classes/Time.md#class-time) class). |
| "datetime" | A date and time, accurate to the [second](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldstoremilliseconds). Represented on the client as a JavaScript `Date` object. See also [dateFormatAndStorage](kb_topics/dateFormatAndStorage.md#kb-topic-date-and-time-format-and-storage). |
| "enum" | A text value constrained to a set of legal values specified by the field's [valueMap](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldvaluemap), as though a [ValidatorType](#type-validatortype) of "isOneOf" had been declared. |
| "intEnum" | An enum whose values are numeric. |
| "sequence" | If you are using the SmartClient SQL datasource connector, a `sequence` is a unique, increasing whole number, incremented whenever a new record is added. Otherwise, `sequence` behaves identically to `integer`. This type is typically used with `field.primaryKey` to auto-generate unique primary keys. See also [DataSourceField.sequenceName](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldsequencename) and [DataSource.sequenceMode](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcesequencemode) |
| "link" | A string representing a well-formed URL. Some components will render this as an HTML link (using an anchor tag for example). |
| "image" | A string representing a well-formed URL that points to an image. Some components will render an IMG tag with the value of this field as the 'src' attribute to render the image. |
| "binary" | Arbitrary binary data. When this field type is present, three additional fields are automatically generated. They are: `<fieldName>`\_filename, `<fieldName>`\_filesize, and `<fieldName>`\_date\_created where `<fieldName>` is the value of the `name` attribute of this field. These fields are marked as [DataSourceField.hidden](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldhidden)`:true` to suppress their rendering by default. You can show one or more of these fields by specifying the field with a `hidden:false` override in the fields array of the databound component. _Stream / view file support for custom DataSources_: a custom DataSource or [DMI](classes/DMI.md#class-dmi) must implement the "viewFile" and "downloadFile" operationTypes and return a single Record with a byte\[\] as the field value for the binary field. For more detail see the overview of [Binary Fields](kb_topics/binaryFields.md#kb-topic-binary-fields). |
| "imageFile" | Binary data comprising an image. Causes [ViewFileItem](#class-viewfileitem) to be used when the field is displayed in a form, allowing the image to optionally be displayed inline. |
| "any" | Fields of this type can contain any data value and have no default formatting or validation behavior. This is useful as the [parent type](classes/SimpleType.md#attr-simpletypeinheritsfrom) for SimpleTypes where you do not want any of the standard validation or formatting logic to be inherited from the standard built-in types. |
| "custom" | Synonymous with "any". |
| "modifier" | Fields of this type are automatically populated by the SmartClient Server with the current authenticated userId as part of "add" and "update" operations. By default, fields of this type are hidden and not editable; the server ignores any value that the client sends in a field of this type (but see also [writeToGeneratedFields](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestwritetogeneratedfields)). Note that the "authenticated user" can be set explicitly on the server-side `RPCManager` using the `setUserId()` method, or it can come from the servlet API if you are using its built-in authentication scheme. See the server-side Javadocs for `RPCManager`. |
| "modifierTimestamp" | Fields of this type are automatically populated by the SmartClient Server with the current date and time as part of "add" and "update" operations. By default, fields of this type are hidden and not editable; the server ignores any value that the client sends in a field of this type (but see also [writeToGeneratedFields](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestwritetogeneratedfields)). |
| "creator" | Fields of this type are automatically populated by the SmartClient Server with the current authenticated userId as part of "add" operations. By default, fields of this type are hidden and not editable; the server ignores any value that the client sends in a field of this type. (but see also [writeToGeneratedFields](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestwritetogeneratedfields)). The notes about type "modifier" also apply to fields of this type. |
| "creatorTimestamp" | Fields of this type are automatically populated by the SmartClient Server with the current date and time as part of an "add" operation (when the record is first created). By default, fields of this type are hidden and not editable; the server ignores any value that the client sends in a field of this type (but see also [writeToGeneratedFields](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestwritetogeneratedfields)). |
| "password" | Same as "text", but causes [PasswordItem](#class-passworditem) to be used by default for editing (hides typed-in value), and defaults [storeWithhash](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldstorewithhash) to "bcrypt" (affecting server operations). |
| "ntext" | A special field type specifically for use with Unicode data in conjunction with the Microsoft SQL Server database. Field type "ntext" implies the use of [sqlStorageStrategy](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldsqlstoragestrategy) "ntext"; other than that, this type is identical to "text" |
| "localeInt" | An integer number with locale-based formatting, e.g. `12,345,678`. See [Localized Number Formatting](#kb-topic-localized-number-formatting) for more info. |
| "localeFloat" | A float number with locale-based formatting, e.g. `12,345.67`. See [Localized Number Formatting](#kb-topic-localized-number-formatting) for more info. |
| "localeCurrency" | A float number with locale-based formatting and using currency symbol, e.g. `$12,345.67`. See [Localized Number Formatting](#kb-topic-localized-number-formatting) for more info. |
| "phoneNumber" | A telephone number. Uses [FormItem.browserInputType](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitembrowserinputtype) "tel" to hint to the device to restrict input. On most mobile devices that have software keyboards, this cause a specialized keyboard to appear which only allows entry of normal phone numbers. When displayed read-only, a "phoneNumber" renders as an HTML link with the "tel:" URL scheme, which will invoke the native phone dialing interface on most mobile devices. In addition, the CSS style "sc\_phoneNumber" is applied.

By default, "phoneNumber" fields do not include validators, however the following validator definition would limit to digits, dashes and the "+" character: xml:

`<validator type="regexp" expression="^(\\(?\\+?\[0-9\]\*\\)?)?\[0-9\_\\- \\(\\)\]\*$" errorMessage="Phone number should be in the correct format e.g. +#(###)###-##-##" />`

or directly in JavaScript:

```
 {type:"regexp", expression:"^(\\(?\\+?[0-9]*\\)?)?[0-9_\\- \\(\\)]*$", 
     errorMessage:"Phone number should be in the correct format e.g. +#(###)###-##-##"}
 
```
and adding "#" and "\*" to the regular expressions above would allow for users to enter special keys sometimes used for extension numbers or pauses |

## Type: FormItemBaseStyle

### Description
This string is the base CSS class name applied to a FormItem (or some part of a form item). See the [formItem styling overview](kb_topics/formItemStyling.md#kb-topic-formitem-styling) for more information about styling formItems.

The specified style name will be modified as the 'state' of the form item changes. Developers should provide appropriately named CSS classes for each stateful style described below:

*   If [FormItem.showPending](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowpending) is true, when the current value differs from the value that would be restored by a call to [DynamicForm.resetValues](classes/DynamicForm.md#method-dynamicformresetvalues), this style will have the suffix "Pending" appended to it.
*   If [FormItem.showFocused](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowfocused) is true, when the form item receives focus, this style will have the suffix "Focused" appended to it.
*   If [FormItem.showOver](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowover) is true, roll-over will be indicated by appending the suffix "Over" appended to the style name. This applies to the [textBoxStyle](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemtextboxstyle) and [controlStyle](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemcontrolstyle) only.
*   If [FormItem.showErrorStyle](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowerrorstyle) is true, if the form item has errors, this style will have the suffix "Error" appended to it.
*   If [FormItem.showDisabled](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowdisabled) is true, when the form item is disabled, this style will have the suffix "Disabled" appended to it.
*   Finally, if [FormItem.showRTL](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemshowrtl) is true, when the form item is in RTL mode, this style will have the suffix "RTL" appended to it.

So for example if the cellStyle for some form item is set to "formCell" and showFocused is true, when the form item receives focus, the form item's cell will have the "formCellFocused" style applied to it.

---
## Type: LayoutPolicy

### Description
Policy controlling how the Layout will manage member sizes on this axis.

Note that, by default, Layouts do _not_ automatically expand the size of all members to match a member that overflows the layout on the breadth axis. This means that a [DynamicForm](classes/DynamicForm.md#class-dynamicform) or other component that can't shrink beyond a minimum width will "stick out" of the Layout, wider than any other member and wider than automatically generated components like resizeBars or sectionHeaders (in a [SectionStack](classes/SectionStack.md#class-sectionstack)).

This is by design: matching the size of overflowing members would cause expensive redraws of all members in the Layout, and with two or more members potentially overflowing, could turn minor browser size reporting bugs or minor glitches in custom components into infinite resizing loops.

If you run into this situation, you can either:

*   set the overflowing member to [overflow](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasoverflow): "auto", so that it scrolls if it needs more space
*   set the Layout as a whole to [overflow](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasoverflow):"auto", so that the whole Layout scrolls when the member overflows
*   define a [resized()](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasresized) handler to manually update the breadth of the layout
*   set [Layout.minBreadthMember](classes/Layout.md#attr-layoutminbreadthmember) to ensure that the available breadth used to expand all (other) members is artificially increased to match the current breadth of the `minBreadthMember` member; the layout will still be overflowed in this case and the reported size from [Canvas.getWidth](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasgetwidth) or [Canvas.getHeight](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasgetheight) won't change, but all members should fill the visible width or height along the breadth axis

For the last approach, given the VLayout `myLayout` and a member `myWideMember`, then we could define the following [resized()](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasresized) handler on `myLayout`:

```
 resized : function () {
     var memberWidth = myWideMember.getVisibleWidth();
     this.setWidth(Math.max(this.getWidth(), memberWidth + offset));
 }
```
where `offset` reflects the difference in width (due to margins, padding, etc.) between the layout and its widest member. In most cases, a fixed offset can be used, but it can also be computed via the calculation:

```
     myLayout.getWidth() - myLayout.getViewportWidth()
 
```
in an override of [draw()](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasdraw) for `myLayout`. (That calculation is not always valid inside the [resized()](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasresized) handler itself.)

Note: the HLayout case is similar- just substitute height where width appears above.

See also [Layout.overflow](classes/Layout.md#attr-layoutoverflow).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Layout.NONE | Layout does not try to size members on the axis at all, merely stacking them (length axis) and leaving them at default breadth. |
| Layout.FILL | Layout sizes members so that they fill the specified size of the layout. The rules are:

*   Any component given an initial pixel size, programmatically resized to a specific pixel size, or drag resized by user action is left at that exact size
*   Any component that [autofits](classes/Button.md#attr-buttonautofit) is given exactly the space it needs, never forced to take up more.
*   All other components split the remaining space equally, or according to their relative percentages.
*   Any component that declares a [Canvas.minWidth](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasminwidth) or [Canvas.minHeight](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasminheight) will never be sized smaller than that size
*   Any component that declares a [Canvas.maxWidth](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasmaxwidth) or [Canvas.maxHeight](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvasmaxheight) will never be sized larger than that size

In addition, components may declare that they have [adaptive sizing](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvascanadaptwidth), and may coordinate with the Layout to render at different sizes according to the amount of available space. |

## Type: LocatorStrategy

### Description
The AutoTest subsystem relies on generating and parsing identifier strings to identify components on the page. A very common pattern is identifying a specific component within a list of possible candidates. There are many many cases where this pattern is used, for example - members in a layout, tabs in a tabset, sections in a section stack.

In order to make these identifiers as robust as possible across minor changes to an application, (such as skin changes, minor layout changes, etc) the system will store multiple pieces of information about a component when generating an identification string to retrieve it from a list of candidates. The system has a default strategy for choosing the order in which to look at these pieces of information but in some cases this can be overridden by setting a `LocatorStrategy`.

By default we use the following strategies in order to identify a component from a list of candidates:

*   `name`: Does not apply in all cases but in cases where a specified `name` attribute has meaning we will use it - for example for [sections in a section stack](classes/SectionStackSection.md#attr-sectionstacksectionname) or [images](classes/Img.md#attr-imgname).
*   `title`: If a title is specified for the component this may be used as a legitimate identifier if it is unique within the component - for example differently titled tabs within a tabset.
*   `index`: Locating by index is typically less robust than by name or title as it is likely to be affected by layout changes on the page.

If an explicit strategy is specified, that will be used to locate the component if possible. If no matching component is found using that strategy, we will continue to try the remaining strategies in order as described above. In other words setting a locatorStrategy to "title" will skip attempting to find a component by name, and instead attempt to find by title - or failing that by index.

In cases where the name is considered definitive, such as for [Tabs](classes/Tab.md#attr-tabname) or [FormItems](classes/FormItem.md#attr-formitemname), no fallback check will occur if a name is provided in the locator but doesn't match a live object - the locator will fail to match anything. Furthermore, in the case of [Tabs](#object-tab), [FormItems](classes/FormItem.md#class-formitem), or collections other than [children of a widget](classes/Canvas.md#attr-canvaschildren), if a title is present in the locator and you haven't specified specified "index" as the strategy, there may be no fallback check using the index if the locator title fails to match.

To avoid the Framework trying to match by name or title where they are assumed definitive and we skip fallback to the remaining locator attributes, you'll need to remove the name or title from the locator in question (or set the locatorStrategy to "index" in the case of the title).

Note that we also support matching by type (see [LocatorTypeStrategy](#type-locatortypestrategy)). Matching by type is used if we were unable to match by name or title or to disambiguate between multiple components with a matching title.

### Values

## Type: MultiInsertNonMatchingStrategy

### Description
For `SQLDataSource` only, the strategy to use to harmonize multiple records when [addData()](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourceadddata) is called with a list of records, and [multiInsertStrategy](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcemultiinsertstrategy) "multipleValues" is in force, and the supplied records do not all contain exactly the same fields. Harmonization is necessary because we only specify a single list of fields to the multi-insert, and each of the multiple `VALUES` clauses must exactly match that list of fields or we will get either SQL errors or corrupted inserts, depending on the underlying database

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "dropRecords" | Drop all records in the record list that do not contain exactly the same fields as the first record |
| "dropFields" | Make all records match the first record in the record list, by dropping any fields from the second and subsequent records that are not present on the first record. If the first record in the record list contains values for field(s) that are missing in any other record in the record list, the other record(s) will be padded with nulls. This is similar to the "padWithNulls" setting below, but it only serves to make the second and subsequent records the same as the first, rather than considering all fields on all records |
| "padWithNulls" | Assemble a list of all fields that appear on ANY record in the record list, and ensure that ALL records in the record list include a value for each of those fields by modifying records to specify a null value for any field(s) the record is missing |

---
## Type: MultiInsertStrategy

### Description
For `SQLDataSource` only, the strategy to use to insert multiple records when [addData()](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourceadddata) is called with a list of records.

### Values

|-------|-------------|
| "simple" | Iterate over the supplied list of records and issue a single-record add for each of them |
| "multipleValues" | Generate a single SQL statement that inserts multiple rows, using a database-specific strategy (usually specifying multiple `VALUES` clauses, but Oracle does not support that approach so we implement the same behavior using subselects). Actually, depending on the number of records to insert and the [batch size](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcemultiinsertbatchsize), this strategy may generate more than one SQL statement |

| "end" | Indicates this relative date should be treated as the end of the specified logical date. |

---
## Type: RelativeDateString

### Description
A string of known format used to specify a datetime offset. For example, a RelativeDateString that represents "one year from today" is written as `"+1y"`.

RelativeDateStrings are comprised of the following parts:

*   direction: the direction in which the quantity applies - one of + or -
*   quantity: the number of units of time to apply - a number
*   timeUnit: an abbreviated timeUnit to use - one of ms/MS (millisecond), s/S (second), mn/MN (minute), h/H (hour), d/D (day), w/W (week), m/M (month), q/Q (quarter, 3-months), y/Y (year), dc/DC (decade) or c/C (century).  
    The timeUnit is case sensitive. A lowercase timeUnit implies an exact offset, so `+1d` refers to the current date / time increased by exactly 24 hours. If the timeUnit is uppercase, it refers to the start or end boundary of the period of time in question, so `+1D` would refer to the end of the day (23:39:59:999) tomorrow, and `-1D` would refer to the start of the day (00:00:00:000) yesterday.
*   \[qualifier\]: an optional timeUnit encapsulated in square-brackets and used to offset the calculation - eg. if +1d is "plus one day", +1d\[W\] is "plus one day from the end of the current week". You may also specify another complete RelativeDateString as the \[qualifier\], which offers more control - eg, +1d\[+1W\] indicates "plus one day from the end of NEXT week".

This format is very flexible. Here are a few example relative date strings:  
`+0D`: End of today. There are often multiple ways to represent the same time using this system - for example this could also be written as `-1ms[+1D]`  
`-0D`: Beginning of today.  
`+1W`: End of next week.  
`+1w[-0W]`: Beginning of next week.  
`+1w[-0D]`: Beginning of the current day of next week.

## Type: RESTAuthenticationType

### Description
Enumeration of the supported authentication types for the [RestConnector](kb_topics/serverRestConnector.md#kb-topic-server-side-rest-connector) implementation. Note, all of these authentication types are secure, but only if you use HTTPS

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "basic" | Use a "Basic" HTTP Authorization header. Requires both a [username](classes/RESTAuthentication.md#attr-restauthenticationusername) and a [password](classes/RESTAuthentication.md#attr-restauthenticationpassword), which are combined and Base64-encoded in the HTTP request header. Note, you can also use this auth type for services that allow for Basic authentication using a combination of user and long-lived API key (ie, an API key or token that is generated by the auth server and is used instead of a password for this particular client application, but does not need to be regularly renewed) |
| "bearerToken" | Use a "Bearer" HTTP Authorization header with a bearer token obtained from an OAuth 2.0 client credentials server or other auth scheme that can generate bearer tokens (also known as API tokens or API keys). This auth type can handle both long-lived tokens, such as API keys that are generated once for an application and never change, and so-called "access tokens" that are only valid for a limited period of time - usually no more than a few hours - and must be refreshed when they expire. See [RESTAuthentication.dataSource](classes/RESTAuthentication.md#attr-restauthenticationdatasource) |
| "authHeader" | Use a manually-constructed HTTP Authorization header. This auth type requires an [authentication dataSource](classes/RESTAuthentication.md#attr-restauthenticationdatasource) that returns a record containing a well-formed Authorization header value in a field called "authorizationHeader" (this can be overridden, see the authentication dataSource docs mentioned above) |

## Type: SummaryFunction

### Description
This is used for client-side or server-side summaries

*   Client-side: Function to produce a summary value based on an array of records and a field definition. An example usage is the [listGrid summary row](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgridshowgridsummary), where a row is shown at the bottom of the listGrid containing summary information about each column.
*   Server-side: Function used for getting summarized field value using [Server Summaries feature](kb_topics/serverSummaries.md#kb-topic-server-summaries) or when [Including values from multiple records](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldincludefrom)

For the client-side SummaryFunctions may be specified in one of 2 ways:

*   as an explicit function or executable [StringMethod](kb_topics/stringMethods.md#kb-topic-string-methods-overview), which will be passed `records` (an array of records) and `field` (the field definition for which the summary is required).
*   as a standard SummaryFunction identifier

For valid ways to configure SummaryFunctions to use server-side feature see the [Server Summaries overview](kb_topics/serverSummaries.md#kb-topic-server-summaries), including how to implement custom summary functions, not just builtin ones listed here (look for "Custom Aggregation" section).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| sum | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, picking up and summing all numeric values for the specified field. Returns null to indicate invalid summary value if any non numeric field values are encountered.  
_Server:_ acts exactly like SQL SUM function. |
| avg | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, picking up all numeric values for the specified field and determining the mean value. Returns null to indicate invalid summary value if any non numeric field values are encountered.  
_Server:_ acts exactly like SQL AVG function. |
| max | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, picking up all values for the specified field and finding the maximum value. Handles numeric fields and date/time/datetime type fields only. Returns null to indicate invalid summary value if any non numeric/date field values are encountered.  
_Server:_ acts exactly like SQL MAX function. |
| min | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, picking up all values for the specified field and finding the minimum value. Handles numeric fields and date/time/datetime type fields only. Returns null to indicate invalid summary value if any non numeric field values are encountered.  
_Server:_ acts exactly like SQL MIN function. |
| multiplier | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, picking up all numeric values for the specified field and multiplying them together. Returns null to indicate invalid summary value if any non numeric field values are encountered.  
_Server:_ **not supported**. |
| count | _Client:_ returns a numeric count of the total number of records passed in.  
_Server:_ acts exactly like SQL COUNT function. |
| title | _Client:_ returns `field.summaryValueTitle` if specified, otherwise `field.title`  
_Server:_ **not supported**. |
| first | _Client:_ Currently the same as the **min** function.  
_Server:_ implemented as SQL MIN function. |
| concat | _Client:_ iterates through the set of records, producing a string with each value concatenated to the end.  
_Server:_ implemented as SQL CONCAT function by the Oracle database driver; other SQL drivers perform an additional query to fetch the values for concatenation. This function is also supported for generic dataSources that do not have inherent support for aggregation - see the description of this in the [allowAggregation](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourceallowaggregation) documentation. Not supported by JPA or Hibernate dataSources. **Note:** This function is only supported for [DataSourceField.includeSummaryFunction](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldincludesummaryfunction); it is **not** supported in other summary contexts, such as [DSRequest.summaryFunctions](classes/DSRequest.md#attr-dsrequestsummaryfunctions). See also [joinPrefix](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldjoinprefix), [joinString](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldjoinstring) and [joinSuffix](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldjoinsuffix) related datasource field attributes. |
| array | _Client:_ The same approach as for "concat"but returning an array of the values, rather than a string concatenation  
_Server:_ The same approach as for "concat", and with the same restrictons and limitations, but returning an array of the values, rather than a string concatenation. |

## Type: TextMatchStyle

### Description
For "fetch" operations, how simple search criteria should be interpreted for text fields (and to some extent numeric fields, see the notes below). For greater flexibility, use [AdvancedCriteria](#object-advancedcriteria).

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| "exact" | case-insensitive exact match ("foo" matches "foo" and "FoO", but not "FooBar") |
| "exactCase" | case-sensitive exact match ("foo" matches only "foo") |
| "substring" | case-insenstive substring match ("foo" matches "foobar" and "BarFoo") |
| "startsWith" | case-insensitive prefix match ("foo" matches "FooBar" but not "BarFoo")

textMatchStyle behavior is consistent across the client and all three of the built-in server DataSource implementations - SQL, Hibernate and JPA - to the maximum extent that is practical. Known inconsistencies, some of which can be tweaked with configuration settings, are described below

*   textMatchStyle can be disabled for any individual field with the [DataSourceField.ignoreTextMatchStyle](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldignoretextmatchstyle) declaration. This behavior is consistent across client and server implementations, with the proviso that case-sensitive behavior is inherently inconsistent in the server-side implementations (see below for a more detailed discussion of this)
*   textMatchStyle is forced to "exactCase" for [primaryKey](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldprimarykey) fields on `update` and `remove` operations, unless [OperationBinding.allowMultiUpdate](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingallowmultiupdate) is in force. This means that a normal update or remove operation - which is constrained by a unique primaryKey value or combination, to affect only a single data row - will use an equality match on all primaryKey fields. This is desirable because it makes index usage more likely. Note that this means the key values "foo" and "FOO" are distinct, which is a change from previous behavior. For most databases, this change will have no effect because most databases do not by default allow primaryKey values that only differ in case anyway - if a table has a row with a PK of "foo" and you try to insert a row with a PK of "FOO", most databases will fail with a constraint violation. However, if you are using a database hat allows key values that differ only in case, and you need to support this for some reason, you can switch the framework back to the previous behavior by setting property `allow.case.sensitive.pks` to `true` in your `server.properties` file. Note, we do not recommend this; in fact, we do not recommend the use of text primaryKey fields at all. Where you have control ,we would always recommend the use of automatically incrementing numeric sequence keys.
*   textMatchStyle does not apply to boolean or temporal (date, datetime, time) [field types](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldtype). Such fields are always checked for equality. If you have a need for more complex matching, such as date-range checking, use AdvancedCriteria
*   Critiera values for temporal fields **must** be real dates (Javascript `Date` objects on the client, instances of `java.util.Date` on the server). Attempting to match against a string or any other type of value will result in an "always fails" clause being generated. This behavior is how the client code has always worked, but is a change for the server-side DataSources, in the interests of consistency. The previous behavior was:
    *   SQLDataSource used to attempt to match the date column to the criteria value provided; if that value was an appropriately-formatted string, that attempt _might_ have worked, but it would be database-specific. If you have an application that depends on this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your `server.properties` file: `sql.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false`
    *   HibernateDataSource and JPADataSource used to skip such clauses altogether, which results in the opposite behavior (there is an implied "always succeeds" clause, because the clause is not present in the query at all). If you have an application that depends on this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your `server.properties` file: `jpa.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false` or `hibernate.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false`, as appropriate
*   textMatchStyle does not apply to fields used in the joins generated to satisfy [includeFrom](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldincludefrom) declarations or entity relations in Hibernate or JPA. Again, such comparisons are always for equality
*   textMatchStyle is applied to numeric fields **only** if the supplied criteria value is a string. So for a numeric field "myNumber", we will match 10, 100, 110 and 1000 if a criteria value of "10" (the quoted string) is supplied, but we will only match 10 if a criteria value of 10 (the actual number) is supplied
    *   This is a change in behavior for the server-side DataSource implementations, in the interests of consistency with the client behavior. Previously, all three of the built-in DataSource implementations applied textMatchStyle to numeric fields regardless of the criteria value's type. If you have an application that depends on this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your `server.properties` file: `sql.substring.numeric.criteria: true` or `hibernate.substring.numeric.criteria: true` or `jpa.substring.numeric.criteria: true`, as appropriate
*   "exactCase" matching cannot be made consistent across all database providers because each database has its own idea of whether case-sensitive matching should be the default, and how to switch it on and off (if that is even possible)
    *   Microsoft SQL Server must have case-sensitive matching enabled by setting a case-sensitive collation when the database is created (there are more fine-grained options, but we do not recommend them because of the scope for further inconsistency, where "exactCase" works correctly on table A but not on table B). See [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175835.aspx) for details
    *   HSQLDB has case sensitivity set with the `SET IGNORECASE` directive - [see here](http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/guide/ch09.html#set_ignorecase-section)
    *   MySQL is case-insensitive, but since it provides an easy way to do per-query, case-sensitive matching in SQL, we work around it for that database, but **only** in SQL DataSources
*   If you are using Hibernate or JPA, whether "exactCase" works as expected depends entirely on the underlying database. Unlike the SQL DataSource, where we have fine-grained control of the SQL that the database executes, we are constrained by what the ORM will allow. This prevents us from compensating for database quirks, like we do with MySQL's case-insensitivity in the SQL DataSource |

## Type: ValueMap

### Description
A ValueMap defines the set of legal values for a field, and optionally allows you to provide a mapping from stored values to values as seen by the end user.

A valueMap can be specified as either an Array of legal values, or as an [Object](#type-object) where each property maps a stored value to a user-displayable value. See [DataSourceField.valueMap](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldvaluemap) for how to express a ValueMap in [Component XML](kb_topics/componentXML.md#kb-topic-component-xml).

A ValueMap can be entirely static or entirely dynamic, with many options in between. For example, a ValueMap may be:

*   statically defined in a JavaScript or XML file. Such a valueMap changes only when application code is upgraded.
*   generated dynamically by server code when the application first loads, for example, by generating JavaScript or XML dynamically in a .jsp or .asp file. Such a valueMap may be different for each session and for each user.
*   loaded on demand from a DataSource, via the [optionDataSource](classes/PickList.md#attr-picklistoptiondatasource) property, or via a call to [DataSource.fetchData](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcefetchdata) where a valueMap is derived dynamically from the returned data (see [DataSource.fetchData](classes/DataSource.md#method-datasourcefetchdata) for an example). Such a valueMap may be updated at any time, for example, every time the user changes a related field while editing data.

See also the [SmartClient Architecture Overview](kb_topics/smartArchitecture.md#kb-topic-smartclient-architecture) to understand the best architecture from a performance and caching perspective.

Note that a `VelocityExpression` must often evaluate to a particular type of value to be useful. For example, [DataSource.requires](classes/DataSource.md#attr-datasourcerequires) must evaluate to true or false (Boolean objects or strings containing those two words), and [Mail.messageData](classes/Mail.md#attr-mailmessagedata) must evaluate to a Java `Map` object, or a Java `List` containing only `Map`s.

As a result of that behavior, the _menu_ parameter passed to methods like [AdaptiveMenuItem.click](classes/AdaptiveMenuItem.md#method-adaptivemenuitemclick) may be null if this item is not currently displayed in a menu. In such cases, developers may call [item.getAdaptiveMenu()](classes/AdaptiveMenuItem.md#method-adaptivemenuitemgetadaptivemenu).

## Object: ClassFactory

### Description
Sets up a real inheritance structure for Javascript objects. We separate out class objects from prototypes, so each gets its own inheritance chain. This allows us to set up superclass calls, maintain class vs. instance variables and more! The ClassFactory is a singleton object that holds the miscellaneous pieces of our inheritance mechanism. Your main interaction with the ClassFactory is to create new classes: `ClassFactory.defineClass("MyClass", "mySuperClass");`

---
## Object: Criterion

### Description
An object representing a criterion to apply to a record.

A criterion is part of the definition of an [AdvancedCriteria](#object-advancedcriteria) object, which is used to filter records according to search criteria.

A criterion consists of an [Criterion.operator](classes/Criterion.md#attr-criterionoperator) and typically a [fieldName](classes/DataSourceField.md#attr-datasourcefieldname) from a [Record](#object-record) and a [value](classes/Criterion.md#attr-criterionvalue) to compare to. However some operators either don't require a value (eg, isNull) or act on other criteria rather than directly on a [Record](#object-record)'s fields (eg, the "and" and "or" logical operators). Also, it is possible to specify a [Criterion.fieldQuery](classes/Criterion.md#attr-criterionfieldquery) instead of a `fieldName` and/or a [Criterion.valueQuery](classes/Criterion.md#attr-criterionvaluequery) instead of a `value`

A shortcut form is also allowed where only `fieldName` and `value` values are provided. In this case the `operator` is assumed to be "equals".

## Object: DateRange

### Description
A JavaScript object specifying a range of dates. Values are [start](#attr-daterangestart) and [end](#attr-daterangeend). If either value is omitted, the range is assumed to be open-ended in that direction - so if dateRange.start is omitted, the range will include any date earlier than the value specified in dateRange.end.

---
## Object: DebugOverflowSettings

### Description
Configuration to control how excessive overflow is reported when you're [debugging overflow](classes/Canvas.md#classmethod-canvasstartdebuggingoverflow).

The general approach is that we track a maximum of [maxTrackedOverflows](classes/DebugOverflowSettings.md#attr-debugoverflowsettingsmaxtrackedoverflows) per canvas across a period of [trackingDuration](classes/DebugOverflowSettings.md#attr-debugoverflowsettingstrackingduration), and if a canvas overflows more than [selfOverflowThreshold](classes/DebugOverflowSettings.md#attr-debugoverflowsettingsselfoverflowthreshold) times not due to any child (checked by looking at the [visible rect](classes/Canvas.md#method-canvasgetvisiblewidth) of each child, then we log a message from the affected canvas reporting the threshold was exceeded.

## Object: DOMElement

### Description
Represents a native DOM element used by the browser.

For example, you can retrieve the DOM element representing the "Set Data" button from ["Empty Grid" Sample](https://www.smartclient.com/smartclient/showcase/?id=emptyGrid) in the SmartClient Feature Explorer using [AutoTest.getElement](classes/AutoTest.md#classmethod-autotestgetelement):

```
 var buttonElement = isc.AutoTest.getElement("scLocator=//testRoot[]/child[Class=IButton||index=1||length=3||classIndex=0||classLength=2||roleIndex=0||roleLength=2||title=Set%20Data||scRole=button]/");
```
This is a more robust way to obtain a DOM element than retreiving it by ID:
```
 var buttonElement = document.getElementById("isc_FZ")
```

## Object: DSRequestModifier

### Description
An object that modifies a dsRequest based on several available values, including preceding responses from the same queue.

**Some elements of this feature are only available with Power or better licenses.** See [smartclient.com/product](http://smartclient.com/product) for details.

You provide a list of DSRequestModifiers as the [OperationBinding.criteria](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingcriteria) or [OperationBinding.values](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingvalues) of an [OperationBinding](classes/OperationBinding.md#class-operationbinding). The ability to modify a request based on responses to earlier requests in the same queue is called [transactionChaining](kb_topics/transactionChaining.md#kb-topic-transaction-chaining).

A DSRequestModifier consists of a [fieldName](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifierfieldname), usually a [value](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifiervalue) and possibly an [operator](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifieroperator) and [start](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifierstart) and/or [end](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifierend) values (applicable to advanced criteria only). The value, start and end settings can be static, or - with Power or better licenses - they can be expressions in the Velocity template language, which will be resolved at runtime, immediately before the DSRequest is executed.

In addition to the standard [Velocity variables](kb_topics/velocitySupport.md#kb-topic-velocity-context-variables), special Velocity variables are available for the _value_ field when used in a `<values>` declaration - see [DSRequestModifier.value](classes/DSRequestModifier.md#attr-dsrequestmodifiervalue) for details.

See below some examples of [OperationBinding.criteria](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingcriteria) declarations:

```
  <operationBindings>
      <operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="...">
          <criteria fieldName="lifeSpan" value="10"/>
          <criteria fieldName="scientificName" value="Gazella thomsoni"/>
      </operationBinding>
      
      <operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="...">
          <criteria fieldName="lifeSpan" operator="greaterThan" value="10" />
      </operationBinding>
  
      <operationBinding operationType="fetch" operationId="...">
          <criteria _constructor="AdvancedCriteria" operator="or">
              <criteria>
                  <Criterion fieldName="lifeSpan" operator="greaterThan" value="10" />
                  <Criterion fieldName="scientificName" operator="contains" value="Octopus" />
              </criteria>
          </criteria>
      </operationBinding>
  </operationBindings>
 
```

And an example of [OperationBinding.values](classes/OperationBinding.md#attr-operationbindingvalues) declarations:

```
 <operationBinding operationType="add">
     <values fieldName="orderID" value="$responseData.last('queuedAdd_order','add').orderID" />
 </operationBinding>
 
```

DSRequestModifiers are intended partly as a security mechanism, so like [Declarative Security](kb_topics/declarativeSecurity.md#kb-topic-declarative-security) features, they apply to requests from browsers, but by default do not apply to requests initiated by server code. To have DSRequestModifiers apply to a server-initiated DSRequest, use either setRPCManager() or setClientRequest().

See the [Master/Detail Add Example](https://www.smartclient.com/smartclient-latest/showcase/?id=queuedAdd) to see this in action.

## Object: Field

### Description
Base type representing a field.

Field container implementations may extend this type with additional attributes and/or methods. For example, [DataSource](classes/DataSource.md#class-datasource) uses [DataSourceField](reference_2.md#object-datasourcefield), [DataBoundComponent](#interface-databoundcomponent) uses [DBCField](#object-dbcfield), and [ListGrid](classes/ListGrid_1.md#class-listgrid) uses [ListGridField](reference_2.md#object-listgridfield) (itself an extension of `DBCField`).

In general, `Field` instances should not be shared with multiple field containers.

---
## Object: FileLoader

### Description
This class enables background (deferred) loading and caching of JS, CSS and Image files. It is designed to work standalone from the rest of the SmartClient framework to provide a lightweight caching and loading mechanism for SmartClient modules as well as user-built application modules/fragments.

The most common usage scenarios are:

*   Caching JS, CSS, Image files in the browser in anticipation of a transition to a page that requires these files. For example, a plain HTML (non-SmartClient) login page or landing page can begin caching SmartClient in the background while allowing the user to login, or giving the user something to read. Normally, loading SmartClient or other large JavaScript files would block page loading and display. By loading SmartClient in the background only after a simple HTML landing page has loaded, you can completely eliminate perceived download time associated with loading a rich UI application, making a much larger difference in user experience than any difference in framework/application size.
*   Loading a multi-phase UI. In this scenario, an initial rendering of a page is done with minimal data transfer to the browser. Then JS, CSS, and Image files are fetched in the background to provide richer UI components. During this time the user can continue to normally interact with the initial page. Once loading is complete, the UI is updated with richer components.

The recommended usage pattern is to use the `loadISC` custom tag provided as part of the SmartClient SDK. You can specify `cacheOnly="true"` to loadISC to cache the SmartClient framework in the background or alternately `defer="true"` to load the SmartClient framework and make it available in the current page. You can specify the `onload` attribute of the tag to provide a JavaScript callback to your code that will be called when the framework loading is complete.

If you're not working in a JSP environment, you can use the [FileLoader.cache](classes/FileLoader.md#classmethod-fileloadercache)/[FileLoader.load](classes/FileLoader.md#classmethod-fileloaderload) APIs to accomplish the same effect as the `loadISC` JSP tag.

Additional APIs are provided for performing dynamic caching and loading of other JS, CSS, and Image files to improve the performance of your application. See below.

**You must set `window.isomorphicDir` before loading and using this module unless the default of '../isomorphic/' is acceptable. E.g. if your html file is in your toplevel webroot directory, then your HTML file should say (note the trailing slash):**

```
 <SCRIPT>window.isomorphicDir='isomorphic/'</SCRIPT>
 <SCRIPT SRC=isomorphic/system/modules/ISC_FileLoader.js></SCRIPT>
 
```
In addition, **if you are using Smart GWT**, you must set [modulesDir](classes/FileLoader.md#classattr-fileloadermodulesdir) to "modules/", as follows:
```
   isc.FileLoader.modulesDir = "modules/";
 
```
This module is usable independent of the rest of SmartClient - you can use it on pages that don't load any other modules. In practice, the general pattern is to use this module on static HTML pages such as a login page to pre-cache SmartClient modules, application logic, skin files, and css so that once the user logs in, there's no latency to load the rich UI.

You can also load the FileLoader itself dynamically - see [FileLoader.ensureLoaded](classes/FileLoader.md#classmethod-fileloaderensureloaded)

Note: You can also reference this class via the alias isc.FL

### Description
A header span appears as a second level of headers in a ListGrid, spanning one or more ListGrid columns and their associated headers.

See [ListGrid.headerSpans](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgridheaderspans).

In addition to the properties documented here, all other properties specified on the headerSpan object will be passed to the [create()](classes/Class.md#classmethod-classcreate) method of the [ListGrid.headerSpanConstructor](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgridheaderspanconstructor). This allows you to set properties such as [Button.baseStyle](classes/Button.md#attr-buttonbasestyle) or [StretchImgButton.src](classes/StretchImgButton.md#attr-stretchimgbuttonsrc) directly in a `headerSpan`.

## Object: ListGridRecord

### Description
A ListGridRecord is a JavaScript Object whose properties contain values for each [ListGridField](reference_2.md#object-listgridfield). A ListGridRecord may have additional properties which affect the record's appearance or behavior, or which hold data for use by custom logic or other, related components.

For example a ListGrid that defines the following fields:

```
 fields : [
     {name: "field1"},
     {name: "field2"}
 ],
 
```
Might have the following data:

```
 data : [
     {field1: "foo", field2: "bar", customProperty:5},
     {field1: "field1 value", field2: "field2 value", enabled:false}
 ]
 
```
Each line of code in the `data` array above creates one JavaScript Object via JavaScript [object literal](#type-objectliteral) notation. These JavaScript Objects are used as ListGridRecords.

Both records shown above have properties whose names match the name property of a ListGridField, as well as additional properties. The second record will be disabled due to `enabled:false`; the first record has a property "customProperty" which will have no effect by default but which may be accessed by custom logic.

After a ListGrid is created and has loaded data, records may be accessed via [listGrid.getData()](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgriddata), for example, listGrid.getData().get(0) retrieves the first record. [ListGrid.data](classes/ListGrid_1.md#attr-listgriddata) may be a [ResultSet](classes/ResultSet.md#class-resultset) if the listGrid is bound to a DataSource. ListGridRecords are also passed to many events, such as [cellClick()](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridcellclick).

A ListGridRecord is always an ordinary JavaScript Object regardless of how the grid's dataset is loaded (static data, java server, XML web service, etc), and so supports the normal behaviors of JavaScript Objects, including accessing and assigning to properties via dot notation:

```
     var fieldValue = record.fieldName;
     record.fieldName = newValue;
 
```

Note however that simply assigning a value to a record won't cause the display to be automatically refreshed - [ListGrid.refreshCell](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridrefreshcell) needs to be called. Also, consider [editValues vs saved values](kb_topics/editing.md#kb-topic-grid-editing) when directly modifying ListGridRecords.

See the attributes in the API tab for the full list of special properties on ListGridRecords that will affect the grid's behavior.

## Object: LoadProjectSettings

### Description
LoadProjectSettings is the bundle of settings that can be passed to loadProject() as the "settings" argument, including optional http parameters for the request to [ProjectLoaderServlet](kb_topics/servletDetails.md#kb-topic-the-core-and-optional-smartclient-servlets).

There is no need to instantiate an LoadProjectSettings instance. Just pass a normal JavaScript object with the desired properties.

---
## Object: LoadScreenSettings

### Description
This is the bundle of settings that can be passed to [RPCManager.loadScreen](classes/RPCManager.md#classmethod-rpcmanagerloadscreen) as the "settings" argument. Some settings can also be passed as separate arguments; if these are present both as separate arguments and in settings, loadScreen() will use the value from the settings.

There is no need to instantiate a `LoadScreenSettings` instance. Just pass a normal JavaScript object with the desired properties.

---
## Object: MenuItem

### Description
Object specifying an item in a [Menu](classes/Menu.md#class-menu). Each `MenuItem` can have a [title](classes/MenuItem.md#attr-menuitemtitle), [icon](classes/MenuItem.md#attr-menuitemicon), [shortcut\\n keys](classes/MenuItem.md#attr-menuitemkeys), optional [MenuItem.submenu](classes/MenuItem.md#attr-menuitemsubmenu) and various other settings. Alternatively, a `MenuItem` can contain an arbitrary widget via [MenuItem.embeddedComponent](classes/MenuItem.md#attr-menuitemembeddedcomponent). MenuItems are specified as plain [JavaScript Objects](#type-object), usually with [ObjectLiteral](#type-objectliteral) notation. For example:
```
 isc.Menu.create({
     items : [
         {title: "item1", click: "alert(1)"},
         {title: "item2"}
     ]
 });
 
```
Do not use `isc.MenuItem.create()` - this is invalid.

Alternatively, Menus support binding to a [DataSource](classes/Menu.md#attr-menudatasource).

As another option, here's a sample of a Menu in [Component XML](kb_topics/componentXML.md#kb-topic-component-xml):

```
 <Menu>
    <items>
        <MenuItem title="item1" click="alert(1)"/>
        <MenuItem title="item2"/>
    </items>
 </Menu>
 
```

## Object: MessageID

### Description

## Object: MetricSettings

### Description
Defines a set of properties that are applicable to [additional value axes](classes/FacetChart.md#attr-facetchartextraaxismetrics) of a [FacetChart](classes/FacetChart.md#class-facetchart).

These properties behave identically to the same-named properties of FacetChart. Two exceptions are the properties [gradationLineProperties](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsgradationlineproperties) and [gradationZeroLineProperties](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsgradationzerolineproperties) because they are used to draw tick marks along an extra value axis instead of lines through the chart rectangle. Also the default behavior of the [dataColors](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsdatacolors) property is different, in that the default is to use unused colors from, and in the order of, the [main data colors array](classes/FacetChart.md#attr-facetchartdatacolors).

The extra value axes that are not positioned directly adjacent to the [chart rect.](classes/FacetChart.md#attr-facetchartshowchartrect) of the FacetChart may additionally have an axis line to connect the gradation tick marks. Whether to draw this line is controlled by the [showAxisLine](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsshowaxisline) property, and the properties of the line are specified using [axisLineProperties](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsaxislineproperties). The default is to draw the axis lines whenever the chart rect. is drawn and to draw the line using the same properties as the lines of the chart rect. (for example, lineColor and lineWidth).

The extra value axis charts may be [single- or multi-facet](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsmultifacet) charts. If the underlying [data](classes/FacetChart.md#attr-facetchartdata) is multi-facet then the extra value axes may use the facet whose values are labelled on the data axis or the facet used to create the legend (the first and second facets, respectively). Both types of charts vary the first facet to get a data series to plot. Multi-facet charts also vary the second facet, but single-facet charts keep the second facet fixed at a constant [FacetValue](#object-facetvalue).

The exact facet value to use for the second facet is specified using the [fixedFacetValue](classes/MetricSettings.md#attr-metricsettingsfixedfacetvalue) property.

A `NavigationBarViewState` object is created to pass to [NavigationBar.setViewState](classes/NavigationBar.md#method-navigationbarsetviewstate) so that multiple properties of the `NavigationBar` can be changed at once.

---
## Object: NodeLocator

### Description
An object containing sufficient context to unambiguously identify a single node in the tree. For normal trees, the node itself - or its ID - is sufficient for this purpose, but for [multi-link trees](classes/Tree.md#method-treeismultilinktree), we also need to know the node's parent, and its position within that parent. For cases where we need to propagate change back up the node's parent chain, in order to maintain a given parent node's openList, the node, parent and position are not enough context; for those cases, we need either the node's position in the tree's openList, or a full path to the node. `NodeLocator` objects contain this extra context, and can be passed to APIs such as [Tree.openFolder](classes/Tree.md#method-treeopenfolder), which would ordinarily accept a parameter of type [TreeNode](reference_2.md#object-treenode).

## Object: StockIcon

### Description
An object that represents a known image by mapping a unique [name](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconname) to an [image-src](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconsrc). The current image-src may be modified at runtime and developers may use these known images by name in any [image-property](#type-scimgurl) - for example, [icon](classes/StatefulCanvas.md#attr-statefulcanvasicon): "Edit" or [src](classes/Img.md#attr-imgsrc): "Accept" would show whatever image-src is [currently mapped](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconsrc) to those builtin stockIcons.
```
 isc.Button.create({ icon: "Edit" });
 isc.Img.create({ src: "Edit" });
 
```

It's also possible to extend a known `StockIcon` each time you use it, by stating it's name followed by a colon and any additional settings supported by the [SCSpriteConfig](#type-scspriteconfig) type. For example, you might be mapping the builtin "Edit" icon to a [stylable SVG Symbol](kb_topics/svgSymbols.md#kb-topic-svg-symbols-overview) (the default behavior of the Shiva skin) and have some edge-case that requires you to show it in red, or even upside down:

```
 isc.Img.create({ src: "Edit:color:red;" });
 isc.Img.create({ src: "Edit:rotate:180;" });
 
```

While a `StockIcon` maps a unique name to an image-src, it can also map **_from_** a known file-path via the [fromSrc property](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconfromsrc). If that attribute is set on a stockIcon, any request for the URL it represents will be mapped to that stockIcon and render its current `src` instead.

Developers may also add custom StockIcons either by calling [addStockIcons()](classes/Media.md#classmethod-mediaaddstockicons) or by passing an existing [IconSet](#object-iconset) to [useMedia()](classes/Media.md#classmethod-mediausemedia), and these can be used in the same way as builtin ones - once installed, code can refer to them by name. Later, the icons can be modified individually or in bulk by calling [updateIconMappings()](classes/Media.md#classmethod-mediaupdateiconmappings) which will update the current src property on the named stockIcons and refresh the UI.

As an example, assume you have multiple projects - each of these has an image in the base dir called "appLogo.png", which is displayed in many places. You could define a StockIcon to map that known file-path to a global name, like this:

```
 isc.Media.addStockIcons([
     {
         name: "AppLogo",
         fromSrc: "[APP]appLogo.png",
         src: null
     }
 ]);
 
```
Now, you can refer to this icon in code by just the name "AppLogo". Because you applied a _fromSrc_, any requests from existing code for that file-path will also be mapped to this StockIcon-name.

So at this point, any code that sets an image-source to either "\[APP\]appLogo.png" or "AppLogo" with render whatever is [currently assigned](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconsrc) to your new StockIcon. Since there is no **_src_** in the definition, it defaults to the **_fromSrc_** and both will render "\[APP\]appLogo.png".

```
 isc.Button.create({ icon: "[APP]appLogo.png" })
 isc.Button.create({ icon: "AppLogo" })
 
```

In the future, you might refresh the UI in your project and want to update your app-logo image. You can easily [assign new mappings](classes/Media.md#classmethod-mediaupdateiconmappings) to any StockIcon at runtime, and all uses of them will be updated to reflect the new [src](classes/StockIcon.md#attr-stockiconsrc).

```
 // define a mapping for the AppLogo image, to a new SVG symbol from a sprite file
 var newMappings = { "AppLogo": "sprite:svg:[APP]svgIcons.svg#appLogo" };
 
 // apply the mapping - this call will update the src property on the StockIcon 
 // and notify the framework that the icon's been updated, so the UI can update
 isc.Media.updateIconMappings(newMappings);
 
```
Anywhere you use the "AppLogo" icon in your code, by name or path (fromSrc), it will now render the updated mapping and show your SVG symbol instead of the original PNG. In this case, because it's an SVG, you can re-style the base StockIcon each time you use it, perhaps changing it's color for use in different contexts.
```
 // perhaps your logo goes red when a critical app-update is pending
 isc.Img.create({ src: "AppLogo:color:red;" });
 
 // or perhaps you show it as a watermark in the background of the page
 isc.Img.create({ src: "AppLogo:size:500,500;opacity:0.2;" });
 
```

For more information about installing multiple new StockIcons at once, or applying overlays of mappings to existing ones, read about [IconSet](#object-iconset) and [Media.useMedia](classes/Media.md#classmethod-mediausemedia).

### Description
Context for an ongoing record summarization operation.

---
## Object: SummarizeRecordsRequest

### Description
Represents a request to AI to generate summaries of records, using data in the records, relevant general knowledge, and reasonable inferences from the data. Summaries may include relevant supplemental information for each record.

The provided [SummarizeRecordsRequest.records](classes/SummarizeRecordsRequest.md#attr-summarizerecordsrequestrecords) are split into batches of varying lengths (see [SummarizeRecordsRequest.maxRecordsPerBatch](classes/SummarizeRecordsRequest.md#attr-summarizerecordsrequestmaxrecordsperbatch)). For each batch, a [SummarizeRecordsPartialResult](#object-summarizerecordspartialresult) will be generated with either information about the reason for a non-successful outcome, or the generated summaries for records in the batch.

## Object: TestFunctionResult

### Description
A TestFunctionResult is an ordinary JavaScript Object with properties that indicate the status of an attempt to generate and execute a function for [FormulaBuilder](classes/FormulaBuilder.md#class-formulabuilder) and it's subclasses.

Because TestFunctionResult is always an ordinary JavaScript Object, it supports the normal behaviors of JavaScript Objects, including accessing and assigning to properties via dot notation:

```
     var propValue = testFunctionResult.propName;
     testFunctionResult.propName = newValue;
 
```

## Object: TreeNode

### Description
Every node in the tree is represented by a TreeNode object which is an object literal with a set of properties that configure the node.

When a Tree is supplied as [TreeGrid.data](classes/TreeGrid.md#attr-treegriddata) to [TreeGrid](classes/TreeGrid.md#class-treegrid), you can also set properties from [ListGridRecord](reference_2.md#object-listgridrecord) on the TreeNode (e.g. setting [ListGridRecord.enabled](classes/ListGridRecord.md#attr-listgridrecordenabled):`false` on the node).

---
## Object: UserAIRequest

### Description
Represents a user-specified and user-modifiable request to AI in some context. For example, the user's request may be in the context of AI-assisted filtering of a [ListGrid](classes/ListGrid_1.md#class-listgrid); in such a context, the user's request is their description of which records they would like to see.

The user's request is combined with other messages, data, and instructions provided by the framework to create [AIRequest](#object-airequest)s that are sent to the AI engine for the purpose of fulfilling the user's request.

## Interface: Chart

### Description
Generic Chart properties and interfaces to be mixed into concrete charting implementations.

Components such as the [ListGrid](classes/ListGrid_2.md#method-listgridchartdata) and [CubeGrid](classes/CubeGrid.md#method-cubegridmakechart) expect this interface and can drive charting engines that support it.

Concrete Chart implementations may expose whatever properties they want for configuration, however, to enable easy switching of charting engines (different engines may be used for different end users based on that user's installed plugins), they should support the properties of this interface to the maximum extent possible.

This interface also provides core data model management (see [getValue()](classes/Chart.md#method-chartgetvalue)) for charting engines.

---
## Interface: List

### Description
An interface for an ordered collection of items.

This is the interface that is expected by list-oriented display components such as the ListGrid. The JavaScript native Array object is retrofitted to support the List interface. Also, a valid List can be created by mixing the List interface into any class that supports:

*   for read-only support: get(position), getLength()
*   for modifiable support: set(position), addAt(object, position), removeAt(position)

NOTE: this interface is compatible with the java.util.List interface, except that:

*   for removal by index, removeAt() must be called instead of remove(). In Java, remove() is an overloaded method that takes either an int or Object, whereas in JavaScript, a Number is an Object.
*   Iterators don't exist.

Some methods from the Java List interface have been omitted from the documentation to avoid redundancy.

---
## Interface: PickList

### Description
Interface to show a drop-down list of pickable options. Used by the [SelectItem](classes/SelectItem.md#class-selectitem) and [ComboBoxItem](classes/ComboBoxItem.md#class-comboboxitem) classes. Depending on the value of [PickList.dataSetType](classes/PickList.md#attr-picklistdatasettype), the generated drop down list of options must be an instance of [PickListMenu](classes/PickListMenu.md#class-picklistmenu) or [PickTreeMenu](#class-picktreemenu), or a subclass thereof.
